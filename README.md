Changelog

In this project, I worked on a new version because my Part 2 project was not running properly on Bluestacks. Although I started a new project, the design, structure, and overall appearance of the app remain the same as in Part 2. The main goal was to implement all the feedback provided and complete the required improvements for the final POE. I implemented validation so that the price field only allows numbers to be entered, preventing letters or symbols. The category section is now presented as a dropdown menu instead of a text input, making it easier to select options. I also fixed the issue where new items were being added to a separate list by ensuring they now appear in the existing menu. Additionally, the item counter now includes both existing and newly added items. Finally, I improved alignment, layout consistency, colors, and font styles across the entire app.
